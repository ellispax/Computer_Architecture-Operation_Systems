Comp Arch &amp; OS Sys Final Project 

Project Done Using Node.Js

This is a chat-room web application created using node.js. It's a monolith application.
User will have to login first and choose their representative class before joining. 
For example, if you choose L4BC, you will sent to L4BC room. Then, you will be able to chat with your fellow student who is also in the same room.

The technology stack we are using is nodejs for backend and html and css for frontend.

We are implementing websocket by using socket.io providing by nodejs.
We are also implementing multithreading by using redis publish/subscribe messaging paradigm.

Redis is an open source (BSD-licensed) in-memory data structure store. It can be used as a database, cache and message broker.
